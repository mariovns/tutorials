Three main financial statements
- The Income Statement shows the manufacturing and selling actions of the enterprise that results in profit or loss
- The Cash Flow Statement details the movements of cash into and out of the coffers of the enterprise
- The Balance Sheet records what the company owns and what it owes, including the owner’s stake

Each statement views the enterprise’s financial health from a different—and very necessary—perspective

## Interrelations
- If the enterprise’s Income Statement shows income, then retained earnings are increased on the Balance Sheet. Either the enterprise’s assets must increase or its liabilities decrease for the Balance Sheet to remain in balance
- the Income Statement shows for a period all the actions taken by the enterprise to either increase assets or decrease liabilities on the Balance Sheet
- Receiving cash from customers decreases the amount that is due the company as accounts receivable shown on the Balance Sheet
- BS & IS can change with non-cash transactions, CFS can't

```
Ending cash in CFS for a period = Cash in BS
Retained Earning += Net Income from IS => Equity increases
**Sales Cycle**
x = Sale on credit => Net Sales in IS + x AND Accounts Receivable in BS + x
y = product value when sale is made => inventory in BS  - y AND COGS in IS + y
z = customer payment => Accounts Receivable in BS - z AND Cash  Receipts  in CFS + z
**Expense Cycle**
Accounts payables in BS += expense in IS => Net Income in IS AND Retained Earnings in BS decreases
x = amt paid => Acc Payables - x AND cash disbursement in CFS + x => Ending Cash in CFS decreases
**Investment Cycle**
Net borrowings in CFS + x => Cash in BS + x => Current Portion of Debt in BS + x or Long term debt in BS + x or x added partially in both
Sale of stock in CFS + y => Ending Cash in CFS + y => Cash in BS + y => Capital Stock in BS + y
**Fixed Asset Cycle**
General & Administrative in IS + x => Accumulated Depreciation in BS + x => Net Fixed Asset in BS - x
PP&E Purchase in CFS + y => Fixed Asset @ cost in BS + y => Net Fixed Asset in BS + y
```

- study the reporting of two things entering or leaving the business
  - Watch the flow of cash money.
  - Watch the flow of goods and services.

Financial statements document the movement of cash and goods and services into and out of the enterprise. That is all financial statements are about
