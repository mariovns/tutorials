## Interrelations
- If the enterprise’s Income Statement shows income, then retained earnings are increased on the Balance Sheet. Either the enterprise’s assets must increase or its liabilities decrease for the Balance Sheet to remain in balance
- the Income Statement shows for a period all the actions taken by the enterprise to either increase assets or decrease liabilities on the Balance Sheet
- Receiving cash from customers decreases the amount that is due the company as accounts receivable shown on the Balance Sheet
- BS & IS can change with non-cash transactions, CFS can't
