# Section A : Financial Statements: Structure & Vocabulary

## Vocabulary
- Sales and revenue are synonymous and mean the “top line” of the Income Statement, the money that comes in from customers
- Profits, earnings and income are all synonymous and mean the “bottom line,” or what is left over from revenue after all the costs and expenses spent in generating that revenue are subtracted. Note revenue and income have different meanings
- Costs are money (mostly for materials and labor) spent making a product. Expenses are money spent to develop it, sell it, account for it and manage this whole making and selling process
- Both costs and expenses become expenditures when money is actually sent to vendors to pay for them
- Orders are placed by customers and signify a request for the future delivery of products. Orders do not have an impact on any of the financial statements in any way until the products are actually shipped. At this point these shipments become sales. Shipments and sales are synonymous
- Solvency means having enough money in the bank to pay your bills. Profitability means that your sales are greater than your costs and expenses. **You can be profitable and insolvent at the same time**. You are making money but still do not have enough cash to pay your bills

```

cost != expense != expenditures
expenditure = cost + expense (Vendor)
profits = sales - cost - expense
orders != shipment
order => future shipments
profits != cash
solvency != profitability
solvency = bills payment capability
profitability = profits > 0
```
