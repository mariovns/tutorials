# Sanskrit
Sanskrit is believed to be oldest language continously spoken. But the long-run is not the main attraction of Sanskrit.
The amazing points about Sanskrit are as following
* the technical arrangement of Sanskrit is one of the unique feature
* the grammar for Sanskrit is one of a kind which is so well versed and distinctive
* Sanskrit is the only language which falls in Formal as well as Natural Language
    * Formal Languages are those who are carefully codified for the machine to understand and process
    * Natural Languages are those constructs which we use for our daily communication.
* In Sanskrit, not just meaning & pronunciation, the sounds, pitch, and tonality are equally important.
* The _Ashtadhyayi_ written by *Panini* has created complete, maximally concise, and theoretically consistent analysis
of Sanskrit grammatical structure. Ashtadhyayi contains
    * 14 lines of sanskrit letters having anubandha at the end.
    * 3976 rules for generation of sanskrit words & sanskrit statements.
    * One could take a phoneme long out of fashion, combine it with other such phonemes, and as long as one follows the
    rules, the output will be a legitimate Sanskrit word, even if that word hadn’t been heard in millennia, or ever
    * using Panini’s rules and meta-rules to create an infinite number of grammatically, syntactically, and semantically
    correct words and sentences
