# Success Begins In The Mind
`Success is a state of mind. If you want success, start thinking of yourself as a success`

## Your attitude is your window to the world
`Attitudes are a secret power working 24 hours a day, for good or bad`
- Same outlet, same dish & same service can give a delightful experience to a person with +ve attitude and can give annoying experience to one with -ve attitude.
- Attitude is the mental filter through which you experience the world *--> Window*
- Behaviour differences due to attitude
 action | +ve | -ve
 --- | --- | ---
 thinks | I can | I can't
 concentrates on | solution | problems
 look for | good in others| fault in others
 focusses on | what he got | what's missing
 sees | possibilities | limitations
- While learning to walk, a baby always gets up again & makes another attempt on stumbling. *--> A clean window*
- But this attitude gets degraded by criticism, rejection, disappointments, bullying, doubts. *--> Dirty window*
- Attitude degradation causes one to give up on their dreams  *--> Unable to clean window*
- Person always have a choice to clean the window or let it getting dirtier => choice to be delightful or annoying.
- **Man's search for meaning** *(book by Dr Frankl)*
  "the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences  alone"
- There's more to success than just having a great attitude.
- *Without a positive attitude, one can't activate the other success principles*
- Success is a light whose path is blocked by dirty window of negative attitude.

`A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes`

## You're a human magnet
`Whether you think you can or you think you can't - you are right`
- We become what we think about
- if you constantly think about a particular goal, then you will take steps to move towards the goal
- *Law of Dominant Thought* Dominant thought rule the day.
- A  little bit just doesn't get the job done
- You can achieve your goal when you believe in yourself and keep your thoughts focussed on the positive
- Positive belief system is starting point for the achievement of any goal
- If your thoughts don't change, your results won't change : Valid for finances, relationships, career
- Repeat to yourself that you can and will accomplish your goal
- Repetition techniques work if you have the discipline to stick with them
- Success requires effort, commitment and patience
- Negative thinking yields negative results.... and positive thinking produces positive results
- [ ] Take a moment to consider your dominant thought in the major areas of your life
- [ ] Become aware of what you say to yourself throughout the day
- [ ] Everyday read and listen some +ve uplifting content [motivational, spiritual, biographies]

## Picture your way to success
`You must first clearly see a thing in your mind before you can do it`
- Many top competitors mentally envision a successful outcome before actually achieving it
- The picture remains in your mind and exerts tremendous influence over your present actions
- You - and only you - are in control of your own movies
- When you don't consciously decide which pictures to play, your mind will look into the "archives" and keep re-playing old movies on file in your mental library
- Today, you can consciously choose to view the situation differently
- We can create new mental movies whenever we choose to do so
- By being patient and by persistently focussing on the mental images, you'll automatically start acting in ways that support your vision
- The more sights, sounds, smells, taste and touches you put inn your pictures, the more powerful the "pull" for you to make your vision a reality
- Also those images associated with strong emotions have even more power
- Jim Carrey *postdated cheque* exercise is a great example of the power of the subconscious mind to actualise a goal that is held with deep conviction and feeling
- Make sure to look at that check at least once a day, and believe that you're moving towards that goal
- create a visual aid and your mind will get to work to bring that picture in your life
- It works both ways, +ve & -ve direction
- [ ] create an image of your desired outcome
- [ ] create a visual aid

## Make a commitment and you'll move mountains
- Key to get what you want is the *willingness to do whatever it takes*
- Once you've made a commitment to achieve your goal, then you'll follow through with relentless determination and action until you attain the desired result
- Until one is committed there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness
- A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising inn one's favour, all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his way.

`Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit`
- You dont have to know at the outset how to achieve your goal : Its not essential that every step be mapped out in advance

`With ordinary talent and extraordinary perseverance, all things are attainable`
- Even with a commitment, life will test you to see how serious you are about achieving your objective.

`You become a champion by fighting one more round`

`One person with a commitment is worth 100 people who have only interest`
- After 10 years of writing D Baldacci had total sales : ZERO, all that he had to show for his efforts were a lot of rejections from editors.

`The rewards for those who persevere far exceed the pain that must precede the victory`

- As long as it takes
- "if it works in first 6 months, then ok, otherwise I quit" : not a mental attitude that leads to success
- Despite your most careful plans, you don't know how long it will take to achieve your goal... you can't foresee all the obstacles that will cross your path
- Committed people are going to hang in - and revail - no matter what

- [ ] Am I willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal?
- [ ] do whatever it takes

## Turn your problems into opportunities
